# __PERFECT DEEP-BLUE__
## INSPIRATION
Everytime some component is upgraded, a feeling is left that _"there's something else that needs to be / could be changed or uprgaded"_. I wanted to get out of this loop. 

The best solution I could come up with was building a machine powerful enough so that there's no need to worry about whether the machine will be capable of performing anything I throw at it (in next 5 yrs). __And it has to look pretty !!!__

Initially the machine was named __"Deep Blue"__ [inspired by IBM chess computer by the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)). If anyone is interested in it's (IBM chess computer) history I'd recommend checking out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwF229U2ba8&t=2892s

But now !!! The name change was warranted. This build has achieved it's final form _(or maybe second final)_. The name change to have __"Perfect"__
prefix is homage to [Cell from DBZ](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Cell) and his changing forms :P 

## LEARNING EXPERIENCE [WHY IT WAS WORTHWHILE]
Building this computer also helped me better understand the concepts which I was unable or not well equiped to understand during school and college. For example:
* Fluid Mechanics                    - (used here for: Liquid cooling loop design & flow efficiency - why laminar flow is so important !!!!)
* Thermodynamics                     - (used here for: Liquid cooling effictive heat transfer & effect of flow on heat transfer in an unstable control system)
* Structure and Properties of Matter - (used here for: Choosing thermal compound - effect of material on conductivity & heat transfer. Also tube bending.)
* Computer Science | Engineering     - (used here for: Understanding MacOS kernel and build macOS stable installer. Apart from usual stuff...)
Overall it was a worthwhile learning experience. I could actually vizualize the concepts which I couldn't understand before which I found to be super cool !!!

## CHANGELOG [DEEP-BLUE -> PERFECT DEEP-BLUE]
* The kinks in the loop has been straightened [mostly cosmetic].
* Achieved laminar flow in the liquid cooling loop (leads to more stable flow rates)
* 3000 RPM Pump + Reservior combo is replaced with new Distro plate + 5000 RPM DDC pump.
* Using nice black-white PSU cables [purely cosmetic].
* Synchronized all the RGB lights to correctly stay on Perfect Blue color :P [purely cosmetic].

## BENCHMARKS
Currently stable memory overclock seems to cause errors in memory. So it was not possible to go beyond 3400 MHz for now. But even at this clock speeds idle memory temperature hovers around 70 degrees which is a bit toasty. These were the reasons for sticking to 3200 MHz.

Cinebench score was pretty decent around: __23,971 pts (all core)__ [LINK](https://github.com/bharanikrishna7/DeepBlue/blob/master/Benchmarks/cinebench.png)

Proper GPU benchmarks have not been performed as I don't create content or play lot of video games (I play only one and it runs at 99 fps in ultra settings, so cant really complain there). But in future I'll be sure to add them when I find sometime.

## HACKINTOSH
Now coming to the interesting part !!! How to run OsX on this machine B-)
There are 2 options here:
### COPY MY EFI AND UPDATE THE PRODUCT INFORMATION [EASY BUT NO LEARNING METHOD]
This method is very easy. It required end user to prepare MacOS Catalina USB installer using a mac and copying my EFI folder. Please follow the steps listed below:
1. Please create a MacOS Catalina USB Installer. Guide: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/
2. Download my EFI folder present at : https://github.com/bharanikrishna7/DeepBlue/blob/master/Hackintosh/EFI.zip
3. Update the platforminfo section in config.plist file using ProperTree and GenSMBIOS tools.
4. Once serial, board serial and SmUUID fields are set correctly using genSMBIOS, mount the EFI partition in the MacOS Installer USB using MountEFI.
5. Copy the entire parent EFI folder (including EFI folder) of the EFI folder we customized into the the mounted EFI USB partition.
6. Umnount the USB Stick partitions and safely remove it.
7. Reboot and update BIOS as per settings : https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-HEDT/skylake-x.html#intel-bios-settings recommended here.
8.  Boot through USB using F11 and Install MacOS [On every reboot always boot from USB and then select appropriate partition to boot].
9. Once MacOS is installed, copy EFI folder from USB Installer Disk to the installed MacOS's EFI partition using MountEFI.
Following the above steps should easily install MacOS Catalina with every feature working as expected.

### FRESH BUILD [HARD BUT THOROUGH METHOD]
To understand how exactly the Opencore framework works and hackintoshing I'd recommend to go through the following resources:
```
1. Opencore Guide: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html
2. Opencore + X299 platform: https://github.com/khronokernel/OpenCore-Asus-X299
```
The above 2 guides and googling should give enough information to understand how opencore works and how to configure it based on the machine specs.
